* Dotfile Literate Configuration

Here lies my digital self...

** Install
*** Homebrew
#+begin_src sh :tangle ~/.local/share/chezmoi/scripts/run_once-install-package.sh.tmpl
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#+end_src

**** Notes
- creates a bunch of dirs
- installs xcode command line tools
- need to hit return to continue
- output message after installing xcode:
Run these commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    echo >> /Users/antoaenono/.zprofile
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/antoaenono/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
- Run brew help to get started
