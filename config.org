* Dotfile Literate Configuration

Here in _the walled garden_ lies my digital self...

** Install
This config is for an Apple silicon device.
*** dotfiles

#+begin_src shell :tangle "install.sh"
git clone github.com/antoaenono/dotfiles.git ~/.local/share/chezmoi
#+end_src

*** Homebrew
...in contrast to MacPorts.

Install via blindly trusting script:
#+begin_src shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#+end_src

**** Notes
- creates a bunch of dirs
- installs xcode command line tools
- need to hit return to continue
- output message after installing xcode:
  Run these commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
      echo >> /Users/antoaenono/.zprofile
      echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/antoaenono/.zprofile
      eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
  - Run brew help to get started
